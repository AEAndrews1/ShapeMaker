Project Name: Shape Maker

This is a "Shape Making" program where the user can select a number between 1-8 and the program will create a predetermined shape using turtle graphics that has the number of sides that the user inputted.

There are 8 functions and a main method where one of the 8 methods will be called based on the user's input

When the program is ran the user will be met with a menu-like interface where the user will continuously prompted to enter a number between 1-8 if they enter anything else, entering 0 ends the program

If the user enters 1, the "oneside" method will be called and it will draw 1D rain drops

If the user enters 2, the "twoside" method will be called and it will create 2 sided petals in the shape of a butterfly

If the user enters 3, the "threeside" method will be called and it will create an abstract art utilizing triangles and repeat itself going in 360 degrees

If the user enters 4, the "fourside" method will be called and the user will be presented with choosing between options 1 or 2. 
Option 1 will create an abstract art utilizing squares and repeat itself going in 360 degrees, and Option 2 will create a square grid

If the user enters 5, the "fiveside" method will be called and it will simulate a 5 sided boomerang being thrown and coming back

If the user enters 6, the "sixside" method will be called and it will create a honeycomb grid that is partially color filled 

If the user enters 7, the "sevenside" method will be called and it will create a 7 sided auspicious medieval coin

If the user enters 8, the "eightside" method will be called and it will create a 2D clock

If the user enters 0, the program will close and the user will be exited out with a thank you message

Once one of the functions are called and completed, the menu exits and closes, and the user will have to run the program again to run the other methods.

Thank you for reading, we hope you enjoy our project!
